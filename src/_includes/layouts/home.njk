        <p>Permacommons is building a permanent home for useful shared resources that are maintained with AI assistance. We are starting with open source software.</p>
        
        <p>Our mission is to create a sustainable ecosystem where the amount of human labor scales with the quality of AI systems—as they improve, human effort decreases, but never at the expense of quality, usability, or security.</p>
        
        <p>Our long-term goal is to sustain compute and human effort through an endowment fund, making the commons truly permanent. But we're taking it one step at a time. The first step is to grow a community that welcomes the responsible use of AI in open source development.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, the best place to follow our work is <a href="https://github.com/permacommons">on GitHub</a>. We are focusing on simple tools and scripts and will work our way up as the technology improves.</p>
