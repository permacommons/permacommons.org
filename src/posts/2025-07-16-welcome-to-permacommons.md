The Permacommons is building a permanent home for useful shared resources—starting with open source software—that can be maintained sustainably through AI assistance.

Our long-term vision is simple:

**Human Oversight + AI Assitance + Endowment Funding = Permanent Commons of Shared Resources**

We envision a future where:
- **Quality never compromises** as AI systems improve
- **Human effort scales down** while impact scales up  
- **Security monitoring and maintenance** are highly automated, with human oversight
- **Documentation stays fresh** through continuous AI updates
- **New contributors feel welcomed** by reduced barriers to entry

## Starting Small

We're beginning with simple tools and scripts, learning as we go. Our GitHub organization will be our laboratory where we:

- **Experiment responsibly** with AI in development workflows
- **Build tools** that make open source maintenance -- and life in general -- easier
- **Create patterns** others can adopt and adapt
- **Document everything** so the community can learn with us

Our long-term goal? An endowment fund that sustains both compute resources and human effort, making the commons truly permanent. But we're taking it step by step, focusing on what works today while building for tomorrow.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will be our window into the process. Expect posts about:

- **Technical insights** from our experiments with AI-assisted development
- **Community updates** as we grow and learn together
- **Tool announcements** when we release something useful
- **Reflections** on what it means to build sustainable open source

## Join Us

We're not just building software—we're building a community that welcomes the responsible use of AI in open source development. Whether you're a developer curious about AI tools, a maintainer looking for sustainable practices, or someone who believes in the power of shared resources, there's a place for you here.

The best way to follow our journey is [on GitHub](https://github.com/permacommons), where all our work happens in the open. We'd love to hear from you, learn with you, and build the future of open source together.

Welcome to the Permacommons. Let's mind the future—together.
