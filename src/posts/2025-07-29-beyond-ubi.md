Why would a company employ a human worker, if a machine will do the job faster and a fraction of the cost?

The answer seems obvious: it wouldn't. If embodied Artificial General Intelligence becomes a reality in the near future, what does that mean for the human beings who get left behind?

There are three common answers to that question:

1) People will be at the mercy of those who take pity on them, or starve.

2) Prices will drop so dramatically that it won't matter: everyone, somehow, will have enough! (Let's call this view "techno-optimism".)

3) Governments will be forced to institute a universal basic income.

The first answer seems obviously undesirable and incompatible with most ethical frameworks.

The second answer seems implausible without a long intervening period during which it won't be true. During that period, many people are likely to suffer, as their basic needs remain unmet.

This brings us to the third answer: UBI. We already know that UBI is extremely unlikely to be adopted _without_ the impetus of mass unemployment and mass civil unrest, at least in the United States.

As of one of the most recent large surveys shows ([Pew 2020](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/08/19/more-americans-oppose-than-favor-the-government-providing-a-universal-basic-income-for-all-adult-citizens/)), UBI is not even particularly popular among the general public in the US. Notably, only 22% of Republicans favored a modest $1,000/month basic income.

Republicans are so strongly opposed to UBI that they are actively advancing laws to [ban such programs altogether](https://stateline.org/2024/04/16/red-states-fight-growing-efforts-to-give-basic-income-cash-to-residents/). The current administration's AI "czar" has said plainly that UBI is ["not going to happen"](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-ai-czar-david-sacks-universal-basic-income-ai-jobs-2025-6) and called it a fantasy of the left.

Would mass unemployment and deprivation at the levels of the Great Depression force governments to adopt UBI? Perhaps so. Governments of every shape do like to stay in power. But it seems likely that the first iterations of UBI will be too little, too late.

## Building with what we have

Instead of waiting for UBI and businesses to create a post-scarcity future for humanity, why don't we use their tools to do it ourselves?

We've been told, again and again, that this is not something we can do. That community-based alternatives to what the market provides can't scale, and won't be sustainable.

Every wave of technological advancement has made this less true: from typewriters to telephones, from computers to the Internet, from AI  to embodied AGI: if you put more powerful tools in the hands of ordinary people, they'll do interesting things.

The most dramatic examples of this are Wikipedia and the large corpus of open source software (Firefox, Blender, VLC, etc., plus the server software, programming language, and applications that power the open web).

Today, every person with access to the Internet has access to a free encyclopedia far more comprehensive than any ever compiled before. Every person with a computer can make movies, process vast amounts of data, call people on the other end of the planet -- for free.

So powerful is the concept of open source that corporations have routinely used it to expand their market share: Google did it with Android and Chrome, Microsoft with VS Code and Node.js, and China is doing it with AI.

## Starting at the bottom

Early LLMs like GPT-3.5 and its successors demonstrated that LLMs can be used to create useful small utilities and functions from user-provided requirements.

Agentic AI is [slowly](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) getting to the point where it can interpret more complex tasks, build, and verify under human supervision.

Businesses will attempt to use this to replace workers. But _we_ can use it to replace businesses.

Today, every person with access to the Internet has access to a free encyclopedia far more comprehensive than any ever compiled before. Every person with a computer can run software to make movies, process data, call people on the other end of the planet -- for free.

By 2030, what else won't you have to pay for?

Every minute we can spend on building things for the common good help prepare for a post-scarcity future. Software is at the bottom of that stack -- it runs the world.

## You can't eat software

Software may drive the world, but it alone cannot feed it, nor can it heal the sick, or house the homeless. To do that, we will need embodied AGI: robotics and autonomous vehicles. To house, to harvest, and yes, to heal.

As their cost goes down and capabilities go up, human communities will be able to pool their resources to buy and maintain small cohorts of robots. To work fields, to operate factories, to transport goods.

Bootstrapping a post-scarcity society is hard. With software, it's easy to bring the cost down to almost entirely the time required for supervision. With robotics and other physical world activities, less so.

## Pooling resources

One model that institutions can use to perpetuate their existence is a financial endowment: you invest a pool of money and you fund whatever work you want from the returns you get on it.

This is common among universities (Harvard's endowment is notably >$50B). Even Wikipedia's parent organization, the Wikimedia Foundation, has an endowment of ~[$150M](https://wikimediaendowment.org/annualreports/2023-2024-annual-report/).

This model has the benefit of ensuring a measure of perpetuity, as long as investing still generates returns. Human labor, compute, and resources paid through an endowment's returns can continue indefinitely.

A single human being with time and compute will increasingly be able to do extraordinary things. Imagine what 1,000 or -- eventually -- 1 million could do.

If we are to inch towards a post-scarcity society, we need more than wishful thinking. We need to actually build it together. It'll take time, but that only means we can't afford to wait any longer.

## First experiments

We're experimenting with the idea of building a permanent commons right here on Permacommons. As this post suggests, we're starting small -- with tiny open source utilities that have demonstrable value, and that can be maintained with the current generation of AI.
